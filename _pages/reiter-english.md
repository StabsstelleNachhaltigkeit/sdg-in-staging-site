<h1>About us</h1>
On February 27, 2019, the Ingolstadt City Council decided to develop a sustainability agenda. To underpin these efforts, the city of Ingolstadt made a voluntary commitment by signing the model resolution “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - Shaping sustainability at municipal level” on July 23, 2020: The global sustainability goals are to be tackled at municipal level. Based on the vision of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the city of Ingolstadt has developed a sustainability strategy in a joint project. Citizens, all social groups, authorities, science, business, social and environmental associations have contributed to this vision for the future. The basis for the current strategy was an inventory carried out in the fall of 2019, which was based on the 17 SDGs. As part of workshops with employees from the city administration, associated companies and members of the city council, an initial target model with indicators for Ingolstadt was developed in 2020. Building on this, the next step was to develop fields of action and key topics for Ingolstadt. These formed the framework for the dialog process entitled “How do we want to live?”. Visions for 2045 were developed with the city's external stakeholder groups and citizens between summer 2021 and summer 2022. On February 28, 2023, the strategy was finally adopted at the same time as the 1st Sustainability Report of the City of Ingolstadt. This will be continuously developed with the involvement of the relevant stakeholders. The last update was adopted by the City Council on February 26, 2025 and is reflected in the 2nd Sustainability Report.<br>

The open dialog with the population was supplemented by the joint development of milestones for sub-goals and desired measures to achieve the goals. The desired measures are taken up by the city administration and sustainability projects are developed and implemented together with the people of Ingolstadt via the dialog project. In future, monitoring of measures will provide an overview of which measures already exist or are planned and will contribute to achieving the goals of the Ingolstadt sustainability agenda.<br>

<h2>Measuring goal attainment</h2>
In addition to the goals and the implementation of measures, the sustainability strategy of the city of Ingolstadt also includes indicator-based monitoring. A total of 123 indicators have been defined to provide an overview of the current status of target achievement and can be found here in the dashboard. A result of the funding project “Dashboard and Monitoring for Municipal Sustainability Strategies” (DashKon), funded by the Service Agency for Communities in One World (SKEW). The indicators are also continuously adapted where necessary. When selecting the SDG indicators, the main focus was on common sustainability indicators (widely used in the literature) and the indicators of the Council for Sustainable Development's Sustainable Municipality Reporting Framework (Berichtsrahmen Nachhaltige Kommune, BNE), which the administration placed in the context of Ingolstadt's sustainability strategy. In addition to publicly accessible sources, numerous official data are also used.<br>

<h2>Open SDG website</h2>
The entire project was funded by the Service Agency Communities in One World (Servicetelle Kommunen in der Einen Welt - SKEW). The SDG-DashKon project builds on the experiences of the SDG-Dashboard, INDIKON and DATAKON projects of recent years. SDG-DashKon is a joint project of SKEW in cooperation with HTW Berlin and the Protestant Institute for Interdisciplinary Research (Forschungsstätte der Evangelischen Studiengemeinschaft e.V. - FEST).
